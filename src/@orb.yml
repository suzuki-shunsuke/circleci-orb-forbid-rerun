  Forbid rerun builds whose revision isn't latest.
  Push tag event isn't supported.
  
  In CircleCI, we can't forbid to rerun old workflows, but sometimes rerun old workflows raises undesirable result.
  For example, 

  * In case of application deployment, old application may be deployed
  * In case of Terraform, existing resources may be destroyed

  This Orb makes the build failure if the build isn't safe.
